4. **Use cases**
    - Participant use cases - how do participants want to use the CL?
    - High throughput data - what should be captured in a Cell Ontology term
    - When to add a term, when will it be accepted?
    
## Preparation

Participants will need to have access to the following resources and tools prior to the training:
- **GitHub account** - register for a free GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)
- **Protege** - Please install Protege 5.5, download it [here](https://protege.stanford.edu/)
- Please try and install **ELK 0.5** (_For a video showing how to install Elk, click [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3td2n48xmwd3mj/Install_ELK_0.5.mov?dl=0)._) 
  - Click here to get the latest [Protege Plugin latest build](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/content?r=snapshots&g=org.semanticweb.elk&a=elk-distribution-protege&e=zip&v=LATEST) (this is available on the bottom of [ELK pages](https://github.com/liveontologies/elk-reasoner/wiki/GettingElk). This will download a zipped file.)
  - When downloaded, unzip and copy puli and elk jars (two .jar files) in the unpacked directory.
  -  Paste these files in your Protege plugin directory. This is in one of two locations:
    - ~/.Protege/plugins (note this is usually hidden from finder, but you can see it in the terminal) **or**
    - Go to Protege in Applications (Finder), right click, 'Show package contents' -> Java -> plugins
  - Restart Protege. You should see ELK 0.5 installed in your Reasoner menu. 
  - Important: it seems Elk 0.5. Does not work with all versions of Protege, in particular, 5.2 and below. These instructions were only tested with Protege 5.5!
- _Optional_ **GitHub Desktop** - Please make sure you have some kind of git client installed on your Machine. If you are new to Git, please install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Set your preferences in Protege, find your ID range [here](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/blob/master/src/ontology/cl-idranges.owl)
